## 🚀 Project Overview

**AuraPulse v2.0** is an advanced IoT-AI hybrid application that transforms any standard computer into a sophisticated **Neural Edge Node**.  

It utilizes high-fidelity acoustic sensors to monitor environmental stress levels and employs an AI Neural Inference Engine to actively mitigate noise pollution through scientifically-tuned bio-acoustic actuators.

Unlike passive monitors, AuraPulse completes the **Sense → Think → Act** IoT loop by generating *Neural Shadow* frequencies and destructive interference patterns to protect user focus and somatic health.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 1. Neural Scan *(AI Labor Illusion)*
Upon initialization, the system performs a **3.8-second Deep Spectral Analysis** to:
- Calibrate local sensors  
- Map the frequency spectrum  
- Identify neural stress patterns  
- Reveal the dashboard after processing  

---

### 🤖 2. AI Neural Inference Engine
The core intelligence module:
- Samples environmental metadata (dB levels & peak frequencies)  
- Provides **real-time AI recommendations**  
- Classifies environment into:
  - 🟢 Optimal  
  - 🟡 Elevated  
  - 🔴 Critical  
- Suggests the most effective bio-acoustic response  

---

### 🛡️ 3. Automated Acoustic Shield
An IoT automation trigger that:
- Monitors decibel spikes (>60 dB)  
- Automatically injects a **174 Hz Somatic Relief tone**  
- Anchors the user’s nervous system  

---

### 🌊 4. Neural ANC *(Spectral Masking)*
A software-driven alternative to hardware ANC:
- Generates pneumatic Brownian noise (“air pump” hiss)  
- Dynamically drifts to mask dominant speech/mechanical frequencies  

---

### 🪐 5. Celestial Resonance Modes
Uses **Cosmic Octave mathematics** to generate grounding tones:

| Mode | Frequency | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 🌍 Earth Year | **136.1 Hz** | Zen “Om” grounding tone |
| 🔴 Mars Orbital | **144.7 Hz** | Promotes vigor & decisive focus |
| 🟠 Jupiter Growth | **183.6 Hz** | Encourages creativity & expansion |

---

## 🔬 Scientific Basis (Frequency Mapping)

AuraPulse incorporates findings from acoustic & neuro-frequency research:

- **40 Hz (Gamma):** Linked to increased cognitive processing speed & alertness  
- **528 Hz (Solfeggio):** Associated with reduced cortisol and stress markers  
- **174 Hz (Foundation):** Used in somatic sound therapy to reduce physical tension  
- **Phase Inversion:** Uses destructive interference math to negate wave amplitudes
